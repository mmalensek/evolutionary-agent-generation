# Search-based procedural evolution of agents

Implementation of a simple evolutionary agent creation algorithm, which are tasked with reaching the finish line in a 1D “platformer” level, where there are certain obstacles like bushes and birds, for which the player has to move accordingly. The goal of the algorithm is to evolve a population of agents represented by sequences of movement commands that navigate the level from start to finish as effectively as possible.
